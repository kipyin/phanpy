By now you should have noticed “all these funny characters” before headlines and within the text. You should also have noticed “these {colored} bubbles”, and wondered how they found their way into this otherwise format-free introduction.

You may even have marveled at how nice everything looks, how beautiful the text is set, how headlines are outdented and lists indented, and how all this is possible without using fancy formatting palettes, rulers and font panels. And, ultimately, what it all means, what it’s good for, and _why you should care_.

Eventually. By design (pun, sorry).

From headlines to lists, to images and footnotes, you simply assign meaning to text passages by entering some easy to remember shortcuts.
