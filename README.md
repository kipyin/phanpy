# PhanPy![](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/3/3b/Spr_3r_231.png)

A project for **P**okémon mec**HAN**isms for **PY**thon.

### Required package:

- [ ] `pandas`

### Supporting Versions & Priorities

```python
GEN.IV >= III > V > VI == VII > I == II
```

- Finishing mechanisms for GEN.III and GEN.IV are on the top of the list.
- GEN.IV is in favor of III when there's a conflict (or better, implement both).

### Current Status / Need-To-Do's
- :tada: Finished building and testing for the underlying classes, i.e. `Pokemon`, `Move`, `Item`, etc.
- :hourglass: WIP: main battle mechanisms.
- :hourglass: WIP: add all moves' effects.
- :calendar: Need to test for the main algorithms.
- :calendar: Need to complete (and update) the documentations.
- :thought_balloon: A better name for the project?
    - This project is intended for *battle* mechanisms, not all mechanisms for Pokémon games (although this might be an option for the future).
- :calendar: Need to adapt the algorithms to cover all 7 generations.
